		<li>Ingredients</li>

		<li>2 large sweet potatoes, evenly chopped</li>
			<li>1/2 medium red onion, diced</li>
			<li>1 can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
			<li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
			<li>1/2 cup prepared guacamole</li>
			<li>1/2 cup crumbled cotija cheese</li>
			<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
			<li>1 tsp ancho chile powder</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
			<li>8 small corn tortillas</li>
		
		<p>Directions:</p>

		<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Sprinkle the sweet potatoes with the cumin, ancho chile powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat. Put in the oven and bake until tender (about 25 minutes total).</p>

		<p>After the sweet potatoes have been baking for about 12 minutes, warm the black beans, onion, and corn over medium heat in a medium skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for about 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the contents to a medium mixing bowl. Mash the black beans and corn until roughly blended and set aside.</p>

		<p>Place the tortillas on a medium baking pan in a single layer. Heat for about 5 minutes or until warm. Remove both the baked sweet potatoes and the warm tortillas from the oven.</p>

		<p>To assemble the layered tostadas, first place a tortilla on a plate and spread evenly with about three tablespoons of black bean and corn mixture. Place a second tortilla on top of the the first tortilla and spread evenly with about 2 tablespoons of guacamole. Scatter about 1/4 cup of the sweet potatoes on top of the guacamole and then sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of cotija cheese. Assemble the remaining tostadas in the same manner and serve.</p>

                <p>Place the panela, cinnamon sticks and 7 cups of water in a large pot and cook over low heat until the panela is dissolved completely...</p>

                <p>Temper eggs: Add ladle of hot milk mixture to the egg mixture and whisk to combine. (This is called tempering, and it prevents the eggs from curdling.) Add two more ladles of milk mixture, one at a time, whisking to combine after each addition. Gradually whisk in remaining milk mixture.

                <p>Add the figs and cook over low heat until the panela has a syrupy consistency, for about 1 hour and 40 minutes stirring occasionally.</p>

                <p>Serve the brevas with queso fresco on the side or refrigerate in a  covered glass jar up to a week.</p>

                <p>Chill and serve: Remove pan from oven. Use tongs to carefully remove ramekins from hot-water bath and place on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Then, cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 8 hours (or up to 3 days). To unmold, run a sharp knife around inside of ramekins, and place a rimmed serving plate upside down over top of each. Invert, and gently lift ramekin to remove. Serve immediately.

       <img src="file:///Users/amandacross/Documents/wdi/mandy_m/flan.jpg" width="350px" height="300px">
           <li><h3>Ingredients</h3></li>
           <li>FOR CARAMEL</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li><br>
            <h3>FOR CUSTARD</h3>
            <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>4 large whole eggs, plus 3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>

            <p>Directions:</p>

				<p>Prepare oven and ramekins: Heat oven to 325 degrees. Place a small bowl of cold water and a pastry brush near the stovetop, and prepare an ice-water bath. Place eight 4-ounce ramekins in a large roasting pan. Bring a large kettle or pot of water to a boil.
                </p>

               <p>Make caramel: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, mix sugar and water, stirring to combine. Do not stir again. Cook, washing down sides of pan with a pastry brush dipped in water to prevent crystals from forming, until caramel is amber, about 8 minutes, swirling pan to color evenly. Remove from heat, and immerse bottom of pan in ice-water bath for 3 seconds to stop cooking. Dry bottom of pan. Working quickly, pour about 1 tablespoon caramel into each ramekin, swirling each to coat bottoms evenly.</p>
               
               <p>Make custard: In a small saucepan, heat milk with half the sugar (1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons) over medium heat just until mixture starts to steam and bubble around the edges, 5 to 6 minutes (do not let it boil).</p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks, remaining sugar, and salt..</p>

                <p>Temper eggs: Add ladle of hot milk mixture to the egg mixture and whisk to combine. (This is called tempering, and it prevents the eggs from curdling.) Add two more ladles of milk mixture, one at a time, whisking to combine after each addition. Gradually whisk in remaining milk mixture.
                </p>

                <p>Strain: Strain through a fine sieve into a large liquid measuring cup or a bowl (to remove any cooked bits of egg). Stir in vanilla.</p>

                <p>Bake: Divide custard evenly among ramekins. Place pan in oven. Add enough boiling water to pan to come halfway up the sides of ramekins. Bake until custards are just set (they should tremble slightly in center when shaken), 35 to 42 minutes.</p>

                <p>Chill and serve: Remove pan from oven. Use tongs to carefully remove ramekins from hot-water bath and place on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Then, cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 8 hours (or up to 3 days). To unmold, run a sharp knife around inside of ramekins, and place a rimmed serving plate upside down over top of each. Invert, and gently lift ramekin to remove. Serve immediately.
